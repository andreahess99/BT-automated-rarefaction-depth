# BT-automated-rarefaction-depth
Additional files for my Bachelor Thesis on automating rarefaction depth selection.

In the experiment data files, the data from most the experiments can be found in csv format. Files called .._k stand for the Kneedle algorithm, .._g stand for the Gradient method.

In the example visualization, the 'rarefaction-depth.qzv' file is an example output that can be viewed in QIIME 2 View. Klick [here](https://view.qiime2.org/visualization/?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreahess99/BT-automated-rarefaction-depth/example_visualization/rarefaction-depth.qzv) to do so. 
In 'example visualization/data' more details can be viewed.
